# Migration Plan from Python to Go

This repository currently contains a FastAPI service written in Python. The goal is to rewrite it in Go. The following high-level plan outlines the steps:

1. **Create a Go module** – a minimal server prototype is located in `spoolman-go/` as a starting point.
2. **Generate server stubs** – Use `oapi-codegen` with the OpenAPI schema generated by `spoolman/docs.py`. The resulting files (`docs/openapi.json` and `docs/openapi_sanitized.json`) can be used to create Go handlers and types.
3. **Database layer** – Map the existing models using the [Ent](https://entgo.io/) ORM. Ent schemas should mirror the current Python SQLAlchemy models.
4. **API implementation** – Fill in the generated handlers with business logic, gradually migrating endpoints from Python to Go.
5. **Testing and CI** – Recreate tests in Go and add a CI job building the Go project to catch errors early.

The rewrite can proceed incrementally. During the transition, both the Python and Go implementations may coexist until feature parity is reached.
