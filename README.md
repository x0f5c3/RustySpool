_Keep track of your inventory of 3D-printer filament spools._

Spoolman is a self-hosted web service designed to help you efficiently manage your 3D printer filament spools and monitor their usage. It acts as a centralized database that seamlessly integrates with popular 3D printing software like [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) and [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)/[Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). When connected, it automatically updates spool weights as printing progresses, giving you real-time insights into filament usage.

### Features
* **Filament Management**: Keep comprehensive records of filament types, manufacturers, and individual spools.
* **API Integration**: The [REST API](https://donkie.github.io/Spoolman/) allows easy integration with other software, facilitating automated workflows and data exchange.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Stay informed with live spool updates through Websockets, providing immediate feedback during printing operations.
* **Central Filament Database**: A community-supported database of manufacturers and filaments simplify adding new spools to your inventory. Contribute by heading to [SpoolmanDB](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB).
* **Web-Based Client**: Spoolman includes a built-in web client that lets you manage data effortlessly:
  * View, create, edit, and delete filament data.
  * Add custom fields to tailor information to your specific needs.
  * Print labels with QR codes for easy spool identification and tracking.
  * Contribute to its translation into 18 languages via [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/spoolman/).
* **Database Support**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and CockroachDB.
* **Multi-Printer Management**: Handles spool updates from several printers simultaneously.
* **Advanced Monitoring**: Integrate with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for detailed historical analysis of filament usage, helping you track and optimize your printing processes. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/wiki/Filament-Usage-History) for instructions on how to set it up.

**Spoolman integrates with:**
  * [Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#spoolman) and most front-ends (Fluidd, KlipperScreen, Mainsail, ...)
  * [OctoPrint](https://github.com/mdziekon/octoprint-spoolman)
  * [OctoEverywhere](https://octoeverywhere.com/spoolman?source=github_spoolman)

## Installation
Please see the [Installation page on the Wiki](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/wiki/Installation) for details how to install Spoolman.

## Go prototype

A minimal Go server resides in `spoolman-go/`. Use `oapi-codegen` with the OpenAPI schema to generate server stubs, and implement database models using [Ent](https://entgo.io/). See [MIGRATION_TO_GO.md](MIGRATION_TO_GO.md) for details.

The OpenAPI document generated from the existing Python service can be found in `docs/openapi.json` (a sanitized version used for code generation is in `docs/openapi_sanitized.json`).
